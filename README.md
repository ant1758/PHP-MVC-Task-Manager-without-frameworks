PHP MVC Task Manager without frameworks

Greetings!

Here you can see a basic example of an MVC application on PHP. 
The project is good for understanding and learning.

The project uses Gulp, which is also interesting to learn. Optional. 

You can also see the demo at http://test-task-manager.zzz.com.ua

To deploy this project on your server you need to create a database, a user, and also enter this data and password into the your_project_dir/app/componnents/DB.php file.
